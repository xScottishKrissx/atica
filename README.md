<p>This was the second of my projects where I used Gatsby. It was a fun project where I returned to the card life, this time, using react-bootstrap to do most of the heavy lifting in terms of the layout and appearance with only a few custom codes snippets here and there.</p>

<p>The main skill I wanted to practice was applying the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API">Intersection Observer </a>API to achieve animation on scroll effects. It's bugged me for a while that I didn't know how to animate elements as you scroll down the page. Well in this project that's what I set out to do.</p>

<p>As you can see from the finished result I think I did a pretty decent job. It's nothing complex but considering I had 0 practice before this then I think it's a solid foundation to build on. I had some issues along the way with stuttery animations and different behaviours between the local host and cloud-deployed versions of the project. These issues were minor and I didn't have too much problem working through them. I think my problem sometimes is that I liked to shoot for the moon(eg applying 20 different animations, animating in sorts of directions) rather than just play it simple and get to grips with the basics before attempting more advanced stuff.</p>

<p>In terms of gatsby, I don't think I spent as much time here as I would have liked but just the process of setting up a project and creating basic queries is good practice.  I definitely want to go more in-depth with what can be done but the main point of this project was to practice the on-scroll animations so I didn't want to get too sidetracked. I also the useEffect hook for the first time in an actual project to achieve the effect of changing the navbar focus as you scroll. I definitely need more exposure and practice to hooks moving forward as I really haven't done anything with them yet. </p>

<p>The other tech I wanted more exposure to was SASS. Most of the time I like to just stick with well-organised CSS but I do understand the benefits of using a pre-processor. I do have experience with them but that was SCSS and while they're not a million miles apart, I do find myself adding curly braces a lot. That's just something I'll get used to the more practice I get.</p>

<p>Overall, a fun exercise that I think will prove valuable moving forward. While I wouldn't consider myself an expert I do feel a lot better about implementing on scroll effects. </p>
