Atica:
  Goals:
    ✔ Practice animate on scroll effects @done(12:14 - 06/10/21)
    ☐ Further practice with Gatsby + GraphiQL
      ☐ Goal, use plugins wherever possible
        // no more <img> , use <Gatsby Image> plugin
        // remember how to install plugins

    ☐ Practice with react-bootstrap
      ☐ Goal, only use react-bootstrap elements for things like buttons, navbar etc
        // custom styles are allowed, but <button> tags are not.

    ☐ Practice with Sass

    Update:
      ☐ Ok, all of the above sounds great but I think im trying too much and getting a bit overwhelmed so new plan:
        ✔ Get the design in place, with all of the trimmings @done(12:14 - 06/10/21)
        ✔ ...then attempt the scroll into view animations with everything in place. @done(12:14 - 06/10/21)
        ☐ Keep pushing ahead with sass, it will be better in the long run even if there's some teething issues
        ☐ Pull back on the bootstrap. It'l be good for general layout but the components annoy me
        ☐ Continue ahead with plugins.


      ☐ Project Ideas
        ☐ Furniture Store...with a giant butterfly at the top of the page for some reason...
        ☐ ...this will work


  To-Do:
    Setup:
      ✔ Create new gatsby project @done(12:57 - 01/10/21)
      ✔ Install react-bootstrap @done(12:57 - 01/10/21)
      ✔ create new workspace @done(12:58 - 01/10/21)
      ✔ create github repo @done(12:58 - 01/10/21)
      ✔ deploy to gatsby hosting @done(13:28 - 01/10/21)


General:
  ✔ Resize images, they're hilariously too big. The butterfly is 14MB. @done(17:27 - 05/10/21)
Navbar:
  ☐ Integrate the navbar with the intersectionObserver stuff
    ☐ I've figured this out although my solution might need to be more optimised, there's a lot of lines for code that does the same thing

Header:
  ✔ Add image @done(12:00 - 04/10/21)
  ✔ Add text @done(13:05 - 06/10/21)
    ✔ Style text @done(13:05 - 06/10/21)
  
Body:
  Card Animation:
    ☐ This is tougher than I thought it would be. Getting the scale is easy enough, getting the smooth in and out animation of the scale is a different thing and requires javascript.
      ☐ ok im getting bogged down here. I dont have a satisfactory solution for this and im spending too much time figuring it out.
        ✔ get the look of the design in place before working on the details. @done(18:06 - 04/10/21)
        ☐ Structure in place, work on the scroll into view animation
          ✔ I have a version of the intersection callback working... 
          @done(12:47 - 05/10/21)
          ✔ ...but i still need to figure out how to target specific divs instead of all h2 tags @done(12:49 - 05/10/21)
            ✔ ok it wasn't hard at all, i was obviously doing some wrong previously. You just put a class name into the query selector and it works fine @done(12:49 - 05/10/21)
          ✔ I have elements on the page fading into view as you scroll down the page. Cool @done(14:01 - 05/10/21)
          ✔ I have some animations that i am happy with. There's a bit of jumpiness but i'm not sure if that's to do with it being in development mode @done(17:28 - 05/10/21)
          ☐ the header and body rows need to be differentiated
            header - start with 1 opacity
            row - start with 0, then fade in
              maybe remove all opacity and try again
          ☐ All of this is being complicated by something going wrong in gatsby/sass. Making a change in my files doesnt always update the page. Adding a space to the end of a class sometimes does so...
          ☐ ...this is a pain in the neck and making troubleshooting a totally random task. I don't know if what i am doing is wrong or if the page just hasn't been updated.
          ☐ My only solution is to move on here. I have completed my main goal of understanding animating when scrolling into view so i have at least made some progress even if things are a bit buggy.
          ☐ I don't know what to do.
            ☐ The project is only randomly updating sometimes when i add a space after a div class. It's making working on this a near impossibility. It's hard enough learning something new, its even harder if the thing you're trying to learn is making it very difficult.
            ☐ Getting demotivated so might call it a day and make a decision tommorow on whether to continue with gatsby. I think the design and project overall is worthwhile so i might switch to a standard react app + firebase to get this over the line.
          
          Ok great, now my to-do isn't working...
            ...but i think i fixed the issue. I took all all of my javascript code and put it inside of a useEffect hook.
            ... i have very little knowledge about hooks but it seems to have fixed the problem of the page not running my code after refresh. Well it is now
            ... i don't see any reason why what I am doing is "bad" as i havent seen any errors and the documentation seems to support that. I am essentially updating the page after render when something happens, so sort of like a componentDidUpdates?? maybe?? 
            ... i really need to educate myself on hooks.

            ...The long and short though is that I can proceed with this project as the problem seems to have been fixed.

            ... now i need to figure out why my to-do plugin isn't working.
        ...this has been a poor few days, lots of smaller issues getting me a little demotivated.  
        ✔ Woo, to-do is working again @done(15:20 - 07/10/21)
        ☐ Note :: import sass in css, it will break the website when attempting to deploy to server.
