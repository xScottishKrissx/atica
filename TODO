  Goals:
    ☐ Practice animate on scroll effects
    ☐ Further practice with Gatsby + GraphiQL
      ☐ Goal, use plugins wherever possible
        // no more <img> , use <Gatsby Image> plugin
        // remember how to install plugins

    ☐ Practice with react-bootstrap
      ☐ Goal, only use react-bootstrap elements for things like buttons, navbar etc
        // custom styles are allowed, but <button> tags are not.

    ☐ Practice with Sass

    Update:
      ☐ Ok, all of the above sounds great but I think im trying too much and getting a bit overwhelmed so new plan:
        ☐ Get the design in place, with all of the trimmings
        ☐ ...then attempt the scroll into view animations with everything in place.
        ☐ Keep pushing ahead with sass, it will be better in the long run even if there's some teething issues
        ☐ Pull back on the bootstrap. It'l be good for general layout but the components annoy me
        ☐ Continue ahead with plugins.


      ☐ Project Ideas
        ☐ Furniture Store...with a giant butterfly at the top of the page for some reason...
        ☐ ...this will work


  To-Do:
    Setup:
      ✔ Create new gatsby project @done(12:57 - 01/10/21)
      ✔ Install react-bootstrap @done(12:57 - 01/10/21)
      ✔ create new workspace @done(12:58 - 01/10/21)
      ✔ create github repo @done(12:58 - 01/10/21)
      ✔ deploy to gatsby hosting @done(13:28 - 01/10/21)

    Getting Started:
      ☐ Get structure of page
      
        ☐ Navbar
        ☐ Header
          ☐ This is where the first "on scroll" will appear. It's not actually on scroll but the technique of playing an animation when something comes into view, is the same.(i think)
        ☐ Body
        ☐ Footer



Navbar:

Header:
  ✔ Add image @done(12:00 - 04/10/21)
  ☐ Add text
    ☐ Style text
  
Body:
  Card Animation:
    ☐ This is tougher than I thought it would be. Getting the scale is easy enough, getting the smooth in and out animation of the scale is a different thing and requires javascript.
      ☐ ok im getting bogged down here. I dont have a satisfactory solution for this and im spending too much time figuring it out.
        ✔ get the look of the design in place before working on the details. @done(18:06 - 04/10/21)
        ☐ Structure in place, work on the scroll into view animation
          ✔ I have a version of the intersection callback working... 
          @done(12:47 - 05/10/21)
          ✔ ...but i still need to figure out how to target specific divs instead of all h2 tags @done(12:49 - 05/10/21)
            ✔ ok it wasn't hard at all, i was obviously doing some wrong previously. You just put a class name into the query selector and it works fine @done(12:49 - 05/10/21)
          ✔ I have elements on the page fading into view as you scroll down the page. Cool @done(14:01 - 05/10/21)
