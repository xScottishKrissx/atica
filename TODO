  Goals:
    ✔ Practice animate on scroll effects @done(12:14 - 06/10/21)
    ✔ Further practice with Gatsby + GraphiQL @done(16:14 - 11/10/21)
      ✘ Goal, use plugins wherever possible @cancelled(16:14 - 11/10/21)
        // no more <img> , use <Gatsby Image> plugin
        // remember how to install plugins

    ✔ Practice with react-bootstrap @done(16:14 - 11/10/21)
      ✔ Goal, only use react-bootstrap elements for things like buttons, navbar etc @done(16:14 - 11/10/21)
        // custom styles are allowed, but <button> tags are not.

    ✔ Practice with Sass @done(16:14 - 11/10/21)

    Update:
      ✔ Ok, all of the above sounds great but I think im trying too much and getting a bit overwhelmed so new plan: @done(16:14 - 11/10/21)
        ✔ Get the design in place, with all of the trimmings @done(12:14 - 06/10/21)
        ✔ ...then attempt the scroll into view animations with everything in place. @done(12:14 - 06/10/21)
        ✔ Keep pushing ahead with sass, it will be better in the long run even if there's some teething issues @done(16:14 - 11/10/21)
        ✔ Pull back on the bootstrap. It'l be good for general layout but the components annoy me @done(16:14 - 11/10/21)
        ✔ Continue ahead with plugins. @done(16:14 - 11/10/21)


      ✔ Project Ideas @done(16:14 - 11/10/21)
        ✔ Furniture Store...with a giant butterfly at the top of the page for some reason... @done(16:14 - 11/10/21)
        ✔ ...this will work @done(16:14 - 11/10/21)


  To-Do:
    Setup:
      ✔ Create new gatsby project @done(12:57 - 01/10/21)
      ✔ Install react-bootstrap @done(12:57 - 01/10/21)
      ✔ create new workspace @done(12:58 - 01/10/21)
      ✔ create github repo @done(12:58 - 01/10/21)
      ✔ deploy to gatsby hosting @done(13:28 - 01/10/21)


General:
  ✔ Resize images, they're hilariously too big. The butterfly is 14MB. @done(17:27 - 05/10/21)
  ✔ I think it's time to split up the file into components. @done(17:49 - 07/10/21)
      ✔ javascript is still a bit much though @done(16:14 - 11/10/21)
  ✔ There's a fair amount of stuttering for some of the animations, especially near the bottom @done(11:55 - 12/10/21)
    ✔ The main barrier to fixing this is that localhost and cloud deployed versions behave differently on load so i can only test this when deployed. not great. @done(16:33 - 11/10/21)
    ✔ I may have a fix that involves just skipping the stuttering start by hiding it behind a fade in. @done(16:35 - 11/10/21)
      ✔ This worked but the our products was stuttery the very first time i loaded the page. Haven't been able to replicate this so it might just be a cache issue. @done(16:36 - 11/10/21)
      ✔ Now i've uploaded it to the portfolio and thats also behaving differently....help. @done(11:55 - 12/10/21)
      ✔ There is something very wrong with my animations @done(11:55 - 12/10/21)
        ✔ On mobile they are VERY stuttery. @done(11:55 - 12/10/21)
        ✔ I think i am going to start again...again. This time start small and find something that works across @done(12:06 - 12/10/21)
          ✔ local host @done(11:56 - 12/10/21)
          ✔ cloud @done(11:56 - 12/10/21)
          ✔ portfolio @done(12:06 - 12/10/21)
          ✔ mobile @done(12:06 - 12/10/21)
        ✔ So yeah, let's rip it out and go again. @done(11:55 - 12/10/21)
          ✔ v2.1 is looking good across all of the above 4. @done(11:55 - 12/10/21)
            ✔ This is the way to go, it's working across all areas, so let's get to work changing things up. @done(11:55 - 12/10/21)
            ✔ When this is done and all platforms are looking good then this project is finished. @done(11:55 - 12/10/21)

Mobile Issues:
  ✔ Some of the cards have a border radius @done(11:36 - 12/10/21)
  ✔ In locations, the glasgow and ayr cards have no space between the, @done(11:36 - 12/10/21)
  ✘ The gap between sections is a little too big, maybe lower this by 50px @cancelled(11:36 - 12/10/21)
  ✔ the navbar takes up a lot of the page height, maybe reduce this by half. @done(11:36 - 12/10/21)
  
Navbar:
  ✔ Integrate the navbar with the intersectionObserver stuff @done(16:14 - 11/10/21)
    ✔ I've figured this out although my solution might need to be more optimised, there's a lot of lines for code that does the same thing @done(16:14 - 11/10/21)
    ✔ I have the on navbar links changing colour as you scroll down the page past the relevant section. @done(16:36 - 07/10/21)
      ✔ I just need to properly style this change @done(16:14 - 11/10/21)

Header:
  ✔ Add image @done(12:00 - 04/10/21)
  ✔ Add text @done(13:05 - 06/10/21)
    ✔ Style text @done(13:05 - 06/10/21)

  
Body:
  Card Animation:
    ✔ This is tougher than I thought it would be. Getting the scale is easy enough, getting the smooth in and out animation of the scale is a different thing and requires javascript. @done(11:55 - 12/10/21)
      ✔ ok im getting bogged down here. I dont have a satisfactory solution for this and im spending too much time figuring it out. @done(11:55 - 12/10/21)
        ✔ get the look of the design in place before working on the details. @done(18:06 - 04/10/21)
        ✔ Structure in place, work on the scroll into view animation @done(11:55 - 12/10/21)
          ✔ I have a version of the intersection callback working... 
          @done(12:47 - 05/10/21)
          ✔ ...but i still need to figure out how to target specific divs instead of all h2 tags @done(12:49 - 05/10/21)
            ✔ ok it wasn't hard at all, i was obviously doing some wrong previously. You just put a class name into the query selector and it works fine @done(12:49 - 05/10/21)
          ✔ I have elements on the page fading into view as you scroll down the page. Cool @done(14:01 - 05/10/21)
          ✔ I have some animations that i am happy with. There's a bit of jumpiness but i'm not sure if that's to do with it being in development mode @done(17:28 - 05/10/21)
          ✘ the header and body rows need to be differentiated @cancelled(11:55 - 12/10/21)
            header - start with 1 opacity
            row - start with 0, then fade in
              maybe remove all opacity and try again
           All of this is being complicated by something going wrong in gatsby/sass. Making a change in my files doesnt always update the page. Adding a space to the end of a class sometimes does so...
           ...this is a pain in the neck and making troubleshooting a totally random task. I don't know if what i am doing is wrong or if the page just hasn't been updated.
           My only solution is to move on here. I have completed my main goal of understanding animating when scrolling into view so i have at least made some progress even if things are a bit buggy.
           I don't know what to do.
             The project is only randomly updating sometimes when i add a space after a div class. It's making working on this a near impossibility. It's hard enough learning something new, its even harder if the thing you're trying to learn is making it very difficult.
            ☐Getting demotivated so might call it a day and make a decision tommorow on whether to continue with gatsby. I think the design and project overall is worthwhile so i might switch to a standard react app + firebase to get this over the line.
          
          Ok great, now my to-do isn't working...
            ...but i think i fixed the issue. I took all all of my javascript code and put it inside of a useEffect hook.
            ... i have very little knowledge about hooks but it seems to have fixed the problem of the page not running my code after refresh. Well it is now
            ... i don't see any reason why what I am doing is "bad" as i havent seen any errors and the documentation seems to support that. I am essentially updating the page after render when something happens, so sort of like a componentDidUpdates?? maybe?? 
            ... i really need to educate myself on hooks.

            ...The long and short though is that I can proceed with this project as the problem seems to have been fixed.

            ... now i need to figure out why my to-do plugin isn't working.
        ...this has been a poor few days, lots of smaller issues getting me a little demotivated.  
        ✔ Woo, to-do is working again @done(15:20 - 07/10/21)
        ✔ Note :: import sass in css, it will break the website when attempting to deploy to server. @done(16:34 - 07/10/21)
        ✔ 7/10/2021 - The make or break day for this project. A lot of issues to be fixed but i got through it. Tommorow i will crack on with more styling to get everything as I want it, then I will look into GraphiQL and start making some pages. @done(18:11 - 07/10/21)
    ✘ I may have a  solution here but it's going to require a change to every component with a card. I might look into creating a dedicated card component here @cancelled(11:55 - 12/10/21)

Team Section:
  ✔ Add 6 cards @done(16:14 - 11/10/21)
    ✔ Include photos for each person @done(16:14 - 11/10/21)
      ✔ Photos in place, names picked and positions applied @done(12:59 - 08/10/21)
        ✔ Style above... @done(16:37 - 08/10/21)
Footer / Subscription Section:
  ✔ Style cards in footer @done(12:32 - 08/10/21)

Footer:
  ✔ Add a proper dedicated footer to the bottom of the page. @done(16:14 - 11/10/21)
    ✔ Include: @done(16:14 - 11/10/21)
      ✔ Logo @done(18:21 - 08/10/21)
      ✔ Atica @done(18:21 - 08/10/21)
      ✘ Contact Info @cancelled(16:14 - 11/10/21)
      ✘ Blurb @cancelled(16:14 - 11/10/21)
    ✔ Footer in, but i would like the 2 columns to be right next to each other @done(16:14 - 11/10/21)
